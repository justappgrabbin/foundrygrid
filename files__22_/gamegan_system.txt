12. System learns and adapts

BEHAVIORAL PREDICTION FACTORS
------------------------------
Primary Factors:
- Openness (weighted 30%): How receptive user is right now
- Emotional State (weighted 20%): Current wave position readiness
- Authority Alignment (weighted 20%): Intervention respects decision style
- Trust Level (weighted 20%): Historical relationship quality
- Resistance Triggers (weighted -30%): What might cause defensive reaction

Secondary Factors:
- Sensory Preference: Visual, auditory, kinesthetic, conceptual
- Processing Mode: Speed, depth, preference (foundational/experiential/observational)
- Definition Type: Single, split, triple split (affects integration time)
- Profile Lines: 1-6 patterns influence learning style

PREDICTION OUTPUTS
------------------
Quantitative:
- acceptance_probability: 0.0 to 1.0
- resistance_level: 0.0 to 1.0
- confidence: 0.0 to 1.0
- openness: 0.0 to 1.0
- trust_level: 0.0 to 1.0

Qualitative:
- optimal_tone: very_gentle | gentle | supportive | direct | directive
- optimal_sense: visual | auditory | kinesthetic | conceptual
- predicted_outcome: integration | partial | delayed | rejection
- emotional_state: excited | balanced | pessimistic | stable
- processing_preference: foundational | experiential | observational | stepped | balanced

Diagnostic:
- warnings[]: Human-readable cautions about intervention approach
- suggestions[]: Actionable recommendations for improvement
- resistance_triggers[]: Specific patterns that triggered resistance detection

CONSCIOUSNESS FRAMEWORK MAPPING
--------------------------------
GameGAN translates Human Design patterns into behavioral predictions:

Type → Receptivity Pattern:
- Manifestor: Low receptivity to directive approaches (0.3)
- Generator: High receptivity when responding (0.6)
- Manifesting Generator: High receptivity when responding (0.6)
- Projector: Very high receptivity to recognition (0.8)
- Reflector: Extremely high openness (0.9)

Authority → Decision Timing:
- Emotional: Needs time to ride wave (patient style = 1.0)
- Sacral: Responds in present moment (responsive style = 1.0)
- Splenic: Spontaneous knowing (spontaneous style = 1.0)
- Ego: Needs empowerment (empowering style = 1.0)
- Self: Needs direction alignment (directional style = 1.0)
- Mental: Needs conversation (conversational style = 1.0)
- Lunar: Needs full cycle (patient style = 1.0)

Centers → Sensory Preference:
- Defined Ajna: Visual + Conceptual preference
- Defined Throat: Auditory preference
- Defined Spleen: Kinesthetic preference
- Defined Solar Plexus: Kinesthetic/Emotional preference

Profile → Processing Style:
- Line 1: Needs foundational understanding
- Line 2: Natural/body-based knowing
- Line 3: Experiential trial-and-error learning
- Line 4: Relational/conversational processing
- Line 5: Projection/visual observation
- Line 6: Observational/witnessing mode

RESISTANCE TRIGGER PATTERNS
----------------------------

- Directive tone to Manifestor (resistance +0.3)
- Pushy approach to Projector (resistance +0.4)
- Rushing Emotional Authority (resistance +0.5)
- Identity questions to undefined G center (resistance +0.3)
- Worth questions to undefined Heart (resistance +0.4)

Medium Resistance Triggers:
- No response opportunity for Generator (resistance +0.2)
- Analytical approach to Splenic Authority (resistance +0.3)
- High complexity for split definition (resistance +0.2)

CONFIDENCE SCORING
------------------
Base confidence: 0.7

Confidence increases when:
- Trust level > 0.6 (+0.1)
- No resistance triggers detected (+0.1)
- Clear sensory preference (+0.05)
- Authority aligned (+0.05)

Confidence decreases when:
- Low data quality (-0.1)
- Conflicting signals (-0.15)
- New user (< 3 sessions) (-0.1)

Maximum confidence: 0.95 (system acknowledges uncertainty)

LEARNING MECHANISM
------------------
Current: Rule-based heuristics (MVP)
Future: Neural network trained on actual outcomes

Feedback Loop:
1. GameGAN makes prediction
2. System delivers intervention
3. User responds (accept/reject/modify)
4. Actual outcome recorded
5. Compare prediction vs actual
6. Update trust level
7. (Future) Retrain neural network weights

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
-----------------------
Dependencies:
- TrinityEngine for chart calculations
- JavaScript runtime (browser or Node.js)
- JSON for data interchange

Performance:

- Memory footprint: < 5MB
- No external API calls required

DEPLOYMENT CONTEXTS
-------------------

MVP LIMITATIONS
---------------
1. Heuristic rules only (not neural network yet)
2. Single Trinity chart analysis (doesn't compare all 3 deeply)
3. No real-time learning (requires manual updates)
4. Simple context tracking (could track more environmental factors)
5. No PhotoGAN integration yet (sensory rendering separate)

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
Phase 3: Neural network implementation
Phase 4: Real-time learning from feedback
Phase 5: Multi-chart comparative analysis
Phase 6: PhotoGAN integration for sensory rendering
Phase 7: Expanded context awareness (time, location, biometrics)
Phase 8: Causal Pattern Transition integration (I Ching evolution)

TESTING SCENARIOS
-----------------
Scenario 1: Projector with Splenic Authority, gentle guidance → High acceptance
Scenario 2: Manifestor with directive approach → High resistance
Scenario 3: Generator with response-based intervention → Optimal alignment
Scenario 4: Reflector with patient lunar timing → Maximum receptivity
Scenario 5: Emotional authority rushed decision → Critical warnings

SUCCESS METRICS
---------------
Prediction Accuracy: > 70% match with actual outcomes
User Satisfaction: Users report guidance feels "natural" and "helpful"
Resistance Reduction: Fewer defensive reactions vs non-predicted interventions
Integration Rate: Higher acceptance of GameGAN-optimized guidance
Trust Growth: Increasing trust levels over session count

This specification defines GameGAN as a complete behavioral prediction system ready for integration into consciousness-aware applications.
